# Description
Small project as a part of school homework. 

# Start
Open app and choose game mode. 
1. "To reveal number": app defines the number you need to guess. 
2. "To define number": you define the number and reply to app's requests about it.

# "To reveal number" description:
1. Enter you guess and click "Make guess".
2. Analyze app's respond and make new guess.
3. If you see "Incorrect number" that means you need to check the number in input. Probably you entered the number with the same digits or with less or more than 4 digits.
4. If you made right guess, app will congratulate you and also it will offer you to name yourself.
5. After that you can restart the game or close the app.
6. You can always check scoring table during the game using the "Scoring table" button in the top right corner.
7. Also you can give up and see the right number. After that you can try again :)

# "To define number" description:
1. App asks you about its guess.
2. Enter your respond and click "Reply".
3. If you see "Incorrect input" than means you probably wrote some extra symbols or clicked the button by mistake.
4. If you cheated on the app, app will find out. Be honest :)
5. When app revealed your number you can restart the game with the "Restart the game" button.
